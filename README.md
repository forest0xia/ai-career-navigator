## Assessment Structure

### 23 Questions Across 5 Sections

| Section | Questions | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Your Current Role** | 4 | Domain, experience, daily tasks, team size — adapts subsequent questions for tech vs. non-tech |
| **Skills & Learning** | 5 | Strongest skills, skill combinations, learning style, cross-functional work, recent learning velocity |
| **AI Familiarity** | 3–4 | Current AI usage, perception of AI, technical depth (adaptive) |
| **AI Tools & Agents** | 2 | Multi-select tool inventory (17 tools), most-valued AI capability |
| **Work Style & Values** | 4 | Work values, disruption response, collaboration style, decision-making approach |
| **Future Orientation** | 4 | 5-year goals, learning investment, risk tolerance, biggest AI concern |

### Adaptive Logic

- First question (domain) sets user tags (`tech`, `creative`, `business`, `regulated`, `physical`, `early`)
- Technical AI depth question only shown to tech professionals
- General tech comfort question only shown to non-tech professionals
- Answer options within questions can be conditionally shown based on tags

### 6 Career Archetypes

| Archetype | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| 🏗️ **AI Architect** | Deep technical + high AI readiness → build AI systems |
| 🤝 **AI Collaborator** | Solid adaptability + growing AI fluency → master working with AI |
| 💎 **Human Edge Specialist** | Strong human skills → double down on what AI can't replicate |
| 🧭 **Strategic Leader** | Leadership + forward-looking → lead AI transformation |
| 🎨 **Creative Innovator** | Creative thinking + adaptability → AI as creative amplifier |
| 🔄 **Career Reinventor** | High adaptability + inflection point → build AI-native skills from scratch |

Each archetype includes 5 action items with:
- **What** to do (the goal)
- **How** to do it (specific steps, timelines, tools)
- **Resource links** (Google AI Essentials, Coursera, Hugging Face, NIST, etc.)

## Analytics & Data Collection

All data is stored in `localStorage` (browser-side, no server needed).

### What's Recorded Per Session

  "feedback": {
    "ratings": { "accuracy": 4, "actionability": 5, "insight": 4, "overall": 4 },
    "comment": "Very actionable advice"
  }
}
```

### Community Features

After 2+ sessions, the results page shows:

- **Radar chart** — your 6-dimension profile overlaid on community average
- **Stats cards** — total assessments, average exposure, average readiness
- **Archetype distribution** — most common archetype with percentage
- **Readiness breakdown** — how many users are well-positioned vs. building vs. early stage
- **Tool rankings** — bar chart of most popular AI tools across all users, with your selections highlighted

### Feedback Collection

Users can rate the assessment on 4 dimensions (1–5 stars each):

| **UI** | `app.js`, `charts.js` | DOM rendering, screen navigation, multi-select handling, radar chart, feedback modal. |

## Customization

### Adding Questions

Add to the `QUESTIONS` array in `src/data/questions.js`:

```js
{
  id: "unique_id",
  section: "role",           // must match a key in SECTIONS
  title: "Your question?",
  insight: "Educational context with <div class=\"source\">— Citation</div>",
  // Optional:
  desc: "Subtitle text",
  showIf: ["tech"],          // only show if user has these tags
  type: "multi",             // for multi-select (omit for single-select)
  options: [
    { text: "Option A", scores: { technical: 2, aiReadiness: 1 } },
    { text: "Option B", scores: { humanEdge: 3 }, tags: ["business"] },  // tags set on first question only
    { text: "Option C", scores: {}, showIf: ["tech"] }                   // conditional option
  ]
}
```

### Adding Archetypes

Add to the `ARCHETYPES` object in `src/data/archetypes.js` and update the scoring logic in `src/engine/scoring.js`.

### Adding AI Tools

Add options to the `ai_tools` question in `src/data/questions.js`. Include a `toolCategory` field for potential future filtering.
